## Hello world!

Recently I wondered aloud whether I should write a blog.
I also wondered if I should call it "Bog standard".

I made a [poll](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@dneto/109772457055894516) to ask, over on Mastodon.
Unfortunately, the poll only had a binary answer.  (What a noob.)
So in the end I don't know how folks felt about either one of my questions, specifically.

One response was ["DO IT"](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@sheredom/109772462178688976) (Thanks, Neil!)
I took that to mean I should get on with it, finally, no matter what I called it.

Well, here I am.  I hope this thing is turned on.

Also, don't hold your breath.  I'm an introvert, after all.

## Postscript

So what happened to the name "Bog standard"?
Well, it was a bit silly to begin with.
And someone already has [a very nice-looking site](https://bogstandardtoiletnews.wordpress.com/)
by that name, for reviews of public toilets.
