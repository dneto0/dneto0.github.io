I am a software developer, currently working in the Chrome team at Google.

This is my personal blog.

I work on GPU language standards, compilers, and related tooling:
* I am an editor for the [WebGPU Shading Language](https://w3.org/TR/WGSL) (WGSL)
* I was chair of the SPIR Working Group at [Khronos](https://khronos.org), working on the [SPIR-V intermediate language](https://khronos.org/spir) for GPUs.
* Some of my team's projects include:
   * [Tint](https://dawn.googlesource.com/tint): A WGSL compiler used by
       Chrome's implementation of [WebGPU](https://w3.org/TR/webgpu).
   * [SPIRV-Tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools): Low level SPIR-V
       utilities including an assembler, disassembler, parser, validator, and optimizer.
       We maintain this on behalf of the Khronos Group.
   * The [SPIR-V backend](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/docs/SPIR-V.rst)
       for [DXC](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler), Microsoft's HLSL compiler.
   * [Clspv](https://github.com/google/clspv): A prototype OpenCL C to Vulkan SPIR-V compiler.
   * [Amber](https://github.com/google/amber): A text-based shader test framework.
   * [Shaderc](https://github.com/google/shaderc): A wrapper around Glslang, a compiler for GLSL to SPIR-V.
   * [Effcee](https://github.com/google/effcee): 
        A C++ library for stateful pattern matching of strings, inspired by LLVM's FileCheck command.
        Use it fast in-process testing such as in googletest.
        It is used to test DXC and SPIRV-Tools.

Previously I worked at Altera, on FPGA CAD, including the first conformant OpenCL implementation for FPGAs.

In 1999 I completed a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Toronto,
under the supervision of Prof. Derek Corneil.
The thesis is *Efficient Cluster Compensation for Lin-Kernighan Heuristics*, [PDF](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/dcs/theses/PhD/1998-99/Neto.phd.pdf)
